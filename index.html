        <p>
          I am a student at Eskisehir Technical University. Also I am working at Birmanya.com as a Freelance IT Manager. After Birmanya.com was founded by Yavuz Selim Cetinkaya, he came up with the idea of working together. After I accepted his
          offer, we
          started working together. Birmanya.com is an online shopping website that has a vision as "Shopping for everybody." In order to achieve this vision we are developing new strategies every day with our precious team. After completing my
          bachelor
          degree in Electrical Engineering I aim to work as a software engineer. Also I am currently working on my photography and cinematography skills. One day I want to shoot my own short film to dare people to think about the issues of being a
          young
          person in Turkey.
